Project Title and Description
AI-Powered Incident Reporting System
This project is an intelligent system for automatically detecting and analyzing potential incidents. The iOS application, developed in Swift, uses phone sensor data to monitor the environment. When an anomaly is detected, the system automatically collects contextual information and uses the multimodal Gemini model to generate a detailed report.

How It Works
The system operates on the following principles:

Sensor Monitoring: The iOS app continuously tracks accelerometer data in the background.

Incident Detection: Upon a sudden spike in readings (e.g., during a collision or fall), the app automatically triggers the data collection process.

Data Capture: The system takes a series of photos and records an audio clip to capture the moment of the incident.

AI Analysis: The collected data (photos and audio transcribed into text) is sent to a Python backend server. The server uses the Gemini API for analysis.

Automated Report Generation: Gemini generates a detailed report, which includes an analysis, a hypothesis, and a danger score.

Notification: The report is sent to Telegram, allowing for instant and automated alerts.

Example Report
Below is an example of a report generated by the AI after an incident was detected.

üö® Report of a Potential Incident as of 12 September 16:59:38

üìç Location:
Link to Google Maps (https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=34.776331355613785,32.42564140281856)

üÜò Danger score: 8/10

Justification: The presence of a sharp object (scissors) held by one individual near another, coupled with an intense facial expression, indicates a potential safety concern or an unusual interaction. The complete lack of audio prevents understanding the context or intent, necessitating further investigation to rule out a serious incident.

üóÇÔ∏è Analysis:

Audio: The audio transcript indicates that speech could not be recognized. This means there is no verbal information available from the recording.

Photos: The image shows two men. The man in the foreground appears to be looking at the camera, with a pair of scissors positioned near his right shoulder. The man behind him, wearing a bucket hat and sunglasses, is holding the scissors and has an intense or slightly aggressive facial expression.

üîó Correlation:

The lack of recognizable speech in the audio, combined with the visual of scissors being held by one person near another, suggests a potentially tense or unusual situation. The absence of audio prevents understanding any verbal exchange that might explain the scene.

üîé Conclusion:

It is plausible that the man in the background is either playfully or threateningly holding scissors near the man in the foreground. The expressions and the presence of a sharp object suggest a non-standard interaction, possibly a prank or a more serious confrontation. Without audio, the intent remains ambiguous.
